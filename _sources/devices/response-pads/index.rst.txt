Triggers
--------

Response pads, as all response devices inside the magnetically shielded room, are
connected to the trigger interface inside the stimulus cabinet. This interface can be
used separately from the interface on the main desk connected to the
:ref:`stimulation PC <stim-pc:Stimulation PC>`. Triggers from response devices
connected to the trigger interface in the stimulus cabinet are combined on the
``STI101`` channel. See :ref:`this section <meg-triggers:STI101 and STI102>` for
additional information.
