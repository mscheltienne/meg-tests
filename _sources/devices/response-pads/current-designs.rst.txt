Current Designs
===============

Response devices from `Current Designs`_ are available through the `932 interface`_.
This interface can simultaneously translate responses as keyboard inputs for the
:ref:`stimulation PC <stim-pc:Stimulation PC>` and as TTL pulses on MEG trigger
channels.

The platform currently provides:

- `4 button (curve left)`_
- `8 button bimanual (curved lines)`_
- `Pneumatic squeeze ball`_

``1x4`` and ``2x4`` curved response buttons are commonly used. A full list of compatible
response devices can be found `here <current-designs response-devices_>`_.
