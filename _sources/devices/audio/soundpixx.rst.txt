SoundPixx
=========

`SoundPixx`_ is a complete MRI/MEG audio system. The system is composed of 3 main
elements: the amplifier, the pneumatic transducer, and the coil headsets.

Amplifier
---------

The amplifier is positioned on the main desk. It is connected to the
:ref:`stimulation PC <stim-pc:Stimulation PC>` through the output ``B`` of the
`Crimson 3`_.

.. tip::

    To select the SoundPixx amplifier, make sure the light ``A to B`` is light up on the
    `Crimson 3`_, indicating that the output ``B`` is selected.

Pneumatic transducer
--------------------

The transducer is outside the magnetically shielded room, in the technical area behind
the MEG system. The frequency response span 20 Hz to 20 kHz.

.. tip::

    Highs are not well covered by this system. Thus, in most cases, the
    :ref:`devices/audio/natus:Natus TIP-300` are preferred.

Coil headset
------------

The coil headset are a pair of MRI/MEG compatible in-ear headphones connected to the
pneumatic transducer. The tip is made of expandable foam that can be shaped to fit the
ear canal. The tip is available in 2 sizes: standard (default) and mini.
