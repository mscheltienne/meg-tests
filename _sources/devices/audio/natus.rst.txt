Also called Etymotic ER-2, the `TIP-300`_ is a high-quality insert earphone for the MEG
system. It connects to the side of the gantry.

This system is preferred on most studies due to the high quality and fidelity of the
sound. However, the transduccers do produce a magnetic field that can interfere with the
MEG signal. It is important to securely fix the transducers on the back of the
participant chair.
