The microphone is connected to the Electro-Optic Unit (EOU 200, single channel) on the
desktop which converts the optical signal to an electrical signal. The EOU unit is
connected to the audio input channel of the
:ref:`stimulation PC <stim-pc:Stimulation PC>`, to a ``misc`` channel of the MEG and to
speakers for feedback.

.. note::

    Due to the 'low' :ref:`sampling rate <meg-settings:Sampling rate>` of the MEG, most
    auditory waveforms can not be sampled by the MEG system. However, it is usually
    possible to observe the onset of the recorded sound.
